## Deployment

Migration is handled in the backend. We have a fixture that is located [here](https://github.com/ongkristopher/Gadget-Management-System/blob/main/backend/gadget_management_system/gadgets/fixtures/initial_data.json):
```bash
  ./backend/gadget_management_system/gadgets/fixtures/initial_data.json
```

To deploy this project, we have a Makefile in the repository that we can use.

Build the image first:
```bash
  make build
```

Start the container:
```bash
  make start
```

If you want to end the container you can now execute this:
```bash
  make down
```
